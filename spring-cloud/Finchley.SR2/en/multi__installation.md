| **Prerequisites:**  to use the encryption and decryption features you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (itâ€™s not there by default). You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded). |
