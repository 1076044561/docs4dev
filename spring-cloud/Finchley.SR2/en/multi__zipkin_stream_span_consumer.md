## 61. Zipkin Stream Span Consumer

|----|----|
|We recommend using Zipkinâ€™s native support for message-based span sending. Starting from the Edgware release, the Zipkin Stream server is deprecated. In the Finchley release, it got removed. |

If for some reason you need to create the deprecated Stream Zipkin server, see the [Dalston Documentation](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Dalston.SR4/multi/multi__span_data_as_messages.html#_zipkin_consumer).
