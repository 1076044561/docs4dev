# Part XI. Spring Boot Cloud CLI

Spring Boot CLI provides [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) command line features for [Spring Cloud](https://github.com/spring-cloud). You can write Groovy scripts to run Spring Cloud component applications (e.g.  `@EnableEurekaServer` ). You can also easily do things like encryption and decryption to support Spring Cloud Config clients with secret configuration values. With the Launcher CLI you can launch services like Eureka, Zipkin, Config Server conveniently all at once from the command line (very useful at development time).

> Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license.
