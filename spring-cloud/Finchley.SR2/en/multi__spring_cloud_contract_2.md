## 88. Spring Cloud Contract

You need confidence when pushing new features to a new application or service in a distributed system. This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications (for both HTTP and message-based interactions), covering a range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, and asserting that a contract is kept by producers and consumers.
