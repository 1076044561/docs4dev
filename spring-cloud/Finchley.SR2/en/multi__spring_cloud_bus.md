# Part VII. Spring Cloud Bus

Spring Cloud Bus links the nodes of a distributed system with a lightweight message broker. This broker can then be used to broadcast state changes (such as configuration changes) or other management instructions. A key idea is that the bus is like a distributed actuator for a Spring Boot application that is scaled out. However, it can also be used as a communication channel between apps. This project provides starters for either an AMQP broker or Kafka as the transport.
