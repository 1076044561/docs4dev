## 70. What to Read Next

There are some [sample groovy scripts](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.1.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/samples) available from the GitHub repository that you can use to try out the Spring Boot CLI. There is also extensive Javadoc throughout the [source code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.1.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-cli/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/cli).

If you find that you reach the limit of the CLI tool, you probably want to look at converting your application to a full Gradle or Maven built “Groovy project”. The next section covers Spring Boot’s "[Build tool plugins](build-tool-plugins.html)", which you can use with Gradle or Maven.
