## 12. What to Read Next

Hopefully, this section provided some of the Spring Boot basics and got you on your way to writing your own applications. If you are a task-oriented type of developer, you might want to jump over to [spring.io](https://spring.io) and check out some of the [getting started](https://spring.io/guides/) guides that solve specific “How do I do that with Spring?” problems. We also have Spring Boot-specific “[How-to](howto.html)” reference documentation.

The [Spring Boot repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) also has a [bunch of samples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.1.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-samples) you can run. The samples are independent of the rest of the code (that is, you do not need to build the rest to run or use the samples).

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read [Part III, “Using Spring Boot”](using-boot.html). If you are really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about [Spring Boot features](boot-features.html).
