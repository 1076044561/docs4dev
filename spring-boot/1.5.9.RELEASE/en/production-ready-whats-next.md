## 62. What to Read Next

If you want to explore some of the concepts discussed in this chapter, you can take a look at the actuator [sample applications](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.1.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-samples). You also might want to read about graphing tools such as [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/).

Otherwise, you can continue on, to read about [‘deployment options’](deployment.html) or jump ahead for some in-depth information about Spring Boot’s [build tool plugins](build-tool-plugins.html).
